# Groups

Breadcrumb's **Groups** feature is designed to enhance the organization and interaction with your data visualizations. With Groups, you can create, manage, and view multiple analytic dashboards within a single space, offering greater clarity and flexibility in your data analysis process.

## Key Benefits of Groups

### 1. Centralized Data Analysis Across Multiple Categories

Groups allow you to house multiple dashboards in one workspace, each tailored to different categories, teams, or projects. This is especially useful for managing metrics across departments or initiatives.

For example:

- A marketing team can track campaign performance in one dashboard.
- A sales team can monitor lead generation in another.

With Groups, you can view and compare these dashboards side by side, enabling faster and more informed decision-making.

### 2. Clearer Visualizations for Complex Data Sets

Organizing large datasets can be overwhelming. Groups tackle this challenge by compartmentalizing visualizations into specific dashboards, ensuring clarity and focus.

Each dashboard can concentrate on a particular set of metrics or visualizations, such as:

- Customer satisfaction by region
- Sales by product category
- Website performance metrics

This structure makes it easier to navigate and digest insights, improving both usability and collaboration.

### 3. Enhanced Customization

Every business and team has unique needs for data visualization, and Groups offer the flexibility to create custom dashboards for any use case.

Customize your dashboards to:

- Focus on specific product lines, regions, or customer segments.
- Compare metrics by placing dashboards side by side, such as sales growth between product categories.
- Monitor operational metrics alongside overall company performance, all within one space.
